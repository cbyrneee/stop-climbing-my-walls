<img width="200px" src="https://i.imgur.com/Ol1Tcf8.png" alt="Requires Fabric API">

**Stop Climbing My Walls** is a mod for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) which gives you the option to stop spiders from
climbing any wall with a game rule.

The game rule is enabled by default (i.e. spiders can climb walls), and can be toggled via the `canSpidersClimbWalls`
game rule.

```
/gamerule canSpidersClimbWalls true <-- Default, spiders are very annoying
/gamerule canSpidersClimbWalls false <-- Spiders are now 100x less annoying in your mob farms
```

### Download

You can get the mod from the [releases page](https://github.com/cbyrneee/stop-climbing-my-walls/releases), or preferably, from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/stop-climbing-my-walls/).
